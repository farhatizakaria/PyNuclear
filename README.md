A script can help you to study nuclear physics :radioactive: for students or teachers :) :school_satchel:
without any error or proplem just give it what it want to get, I mean the essentiel Data to help you.
This program have many methods so it's could be difficulte to understand the script " if you a beginner in Python ", I suggest you to learn the basics of the atomic masses and atomic energies

## Install

``$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt ``

## OS SUPPORT
* Windows for all versions that support Python3

* Linux

* Mac

## The objective of Petron
Help people for stuying the basics of Nuclear Physics 
[Download Nuclear Physics Formula Sheet (PDF)](./formula.pdf)


## ðŸ“„ Nuclear Physics Formula Sheet

### 1. Number of Neutrons
$$N = A - Z$$

### 2. Mass Deficiency
$$\Delta m = (Z \cdot m_p + N \cdot m_n) - m_{\text{nuclide}}$$

### 3. Binding Energy
$$E_b = \Delta m \cdot u$$

### 4. Binding Energy per Nucleon
$$E_{b,\text{per nucleon}} = \frac{E_b}{A}$$

### 5. Fragmentation Energy
- **Per mole:**
$$E_f = n_{\text{mol}} \cdot N_A \cdot E_{\text{nuclear}}$$

- **Per gram:**
$$E_f = \left(\frac{m_g \cdot N_A}{A}\right) \cdot E_{\text{nuclear}}$$

### 6. Radioactive Decay Time
$$t = \frac{-\ln(N) \cdot T_{1/2}}{\ln(2)}$$

### 7. Decay Constant
$$\lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}$$

### 8. Mean Lifetime
$$\tau = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$


## Asking for help
you can make an issue and I'll respond you quickly as I can !

## The technical support
24h / 24 and 7days / 7
you can also send an E-Mail if there's a bugs or errors :wink:

Good luck :microscope:
